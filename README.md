# Bachelor's Thesis Summary
For my bachelor’s project, I developed a mobile application designed to simplify vacation planning. I created features that generate personalized travel itineraries, integrating tools like Google Maps and AI Trip Planner to enhance user experience. Using Android Studio and Firebase, I built a platform that allows users to save travel locations, organize trips efficiently, and reduce the time spent on planning. This project reflects my passion for travel technology and demonstrates my expertise in mobile app development, database management, and user-focused design.
